> *"Rewrite the rules. Unlock the potential."*

**DarkCore Manager** is a next-generation, high-performance interface for managing your GreenLuma 2024+ library. Built in **Rust** for blazing speed and memory safety, it replaces legitimate Python scripts with a robust, compiled binary that feels as premium as the games you play.

## ⚡ CORE FEATURES

### 🎨 **Cyberpunk Interface**
A fully custom GUI built with `egui` featuring:
- **Reactive UI**: Smooth animations and hover effects.
- **Async Cover Art**: High-quality game covers loaded instantly without freezing the app.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-accelerated rendering for 144Hz smoothness.

### 📂 **Profile Manager (NEW)**
**Bypass the 134-Game Limit.**
- Create unlimited "Loadouts" (e.g., *FPS Collection*, *RPG Epics*, *Co-Op Night*).
- Swap entire libraries in milliseconds.
- Never manually edit text files again.

### 🧠 **Smart Logic**
- **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting a main game? DarkCore finds its DLCs and offers to clean them up too.
- **Depot Detective**: Scans your `depotcache` to identify "Unknown" IDs and labels them correctly.
- **Limit Enforcer**: Prevents accidental breakage by locking installations when limits are reached.

### 🛠 **Underground Utilities**
- **DRM Analyzer**: Integrated Steamless handling to unpack EXEs.
- **Hybrid Resolver**: proprietary "Morrenus" API + Steam Fallback to name every unknown AppID.
- **Safe Nuke**: Reorder your library without breaking game updates.
